                <img src="./Images/profile-picture.png" alt="Picture Of Kyron Robinson">
                <p>A Computer Science Graduate from the University Of Kent with a passion for web and software
                    development. The tech sphere has been an interest of mine since my early
                    teenage years where I was intrigued on the fundementals of how computers & parts work which has
                    expanded into a high interest in computer science and programming. In my spare time I like to make
                    projects, learn about new frameworks and in general how the tech world is evolving. Most of my
                    experience comes from frontend work but I am currently developing my skills to be more flexible as a
                    full stack developer, and eventually also have the skills to be a competent user of AWS & Azure.
